# Autonomous Reachability-based Manipulator Trajectory Design (ARMTD)
This repo contains the code for our recent paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01591

## Setup Requirements
To run this code, you'll need the [simulator repo](https://github.com/skousik/simulator), and MATLAB R2018b or newer.

All of the code has a non-GPU version, but it isn't usually real-time fast. You may have to recompile the CUDA mex files for your own system, if you're using a GPU.

## How to Use
We will update this repo, and clean it up, to be more user-friendly. For now, check out the files in [this folder](https://github.com/ramvasudevan/arm_planning/tree/master/simulator_files/examples):
`arm_planning > simulator_files > examples`

## Credits
All the code here was written by Patrick Holmes, Bohao Zhang, Shreyas Kousik, Daphna Raz, and Corina Barbalata.
